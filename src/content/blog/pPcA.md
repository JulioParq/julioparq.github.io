This work addresses the question: What is art? While it engages with philosophical concepts, it does not do so in a purely metaphysical senseâ€”certainly not in the Platonic metaphysical sense. Instead, it inverts that system. Here, ideas are the projected shadows, and being is not something beyond but something present, encompassing and saturating everything. In this context, the answer provided is itself a shadow, an idea of being that is art, a reflection of the reality that art, as a practice, embodies in the world. The answer is simple, though its explanation is not: art is a prosthesis. Art is encompassed within the concept of prosthesis. This concept is developed here, followed by an exploration of the implications of this statement.

(Keywords: art, prosthesis, system, lack, artificial, concept, symbol, aesthetics)
