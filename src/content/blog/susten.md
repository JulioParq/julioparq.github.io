This work stems from the recognition of a negative existence and the necessity to negate that form of existence. It engages with the problem of the lack of a formalized conceptualization of "sustainability," in contrast to the increasing use of the term, which often seems to emerge more from ambiguity than from a deep understanding of the issue. The work then identifies that within the semantic disorder surrounding the term "sustain," which serves as the lexical base of "sustainability," there exists a "generative core." This core functions as the correlate of an "equivalency space" that enables the articulation of the term's polysemy. Furthermore, it becomes evident that it is possible to develop a conceptual framework for "sustain," allowing for the formalization of the generative core within a logical structure. From this developed logic, the work proposes the specificity of "sustainability" as a particular instance of "sustain," leading to the specification of its conceptual cipher, its status, and the configuration of its connections.
