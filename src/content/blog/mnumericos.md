This work was developed as a ‚Äúfinal Project‚Äù for the Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics. It focuses on the structural analysis of type C buildings (reinforced masonry structures) within the Mexican context. The primary objective is to apply numerical methods for conducting such analyses, utilizing open-source computer tools for implementation. The study is mainly descriptive and unfolds in three interrelated stages: first, the characterization of a masonry structure and the design of a typical model; second, a detailed description of the modeling methods for masonry structures and the numerical methods applicable to this specific problem; and finally, the implementation of these methods using open-source computer tools, applied to the designed model.

(Keywords: numerical methods, structural analysis, masonry structures, open-source tools)
